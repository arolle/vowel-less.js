# vowel-less.js (yes it rhymes)

"r y bl t rd ths shrt phrs?" (Are you able to read this short phrase?)  
If not improve that!

Get the bookmarklet on the project page: [arolle.github.com/vowel-less.js/](http://arolle.github.com/vowel-less.js/)

The bookmarklet calls the `vowel-less.js` javascript file. That removes all vowels (and vowel like) characters from an HTML document.

## languages
The bookmarklet works for the languages:

- English (`aeiou`)
- Scottish (`aeiouàìòù`)
- French (`aeiouáâàéêèù`)
- German (`aeiouäöü`)
- Swedish (`aeiouåäö`)

Help to expand that list!

## TODO

- remove vowels from certain attributes (e.g. `alt, title, value, placeholder`)
